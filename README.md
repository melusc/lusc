Here you can find some useful userscripts for moodle. I have only ever tested them on my school's moodle, though.

To run these you need to have tampermonkey, greasymonkey or similar installed.

Currently, all these userscripts are written in es6, using preact and [htm](https://github.com/developit/htm).

If settings are required for use, they are accessible by clicking "Open settings" in menu.
