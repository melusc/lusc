Below are some Userscripts I made to mainly improve Moodle.

Most are out of date and not very efficient or well-designed (source code wise) so I have improved them or rewritten them entirely but am not really releasing them anymore.
Feel free to use them anyway.

On https://melusc.github.io/ I have random things I made for fun.

Also check out the [extension](https://github.com/melusc/schulNetz-extension/) I made for Firefox, it calculates your marks to check if you're passing.
