#### 1. Make sure you have [greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), tampermonkey ([c](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)/[f](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)) or similar installed for this to work
* I prefer tampermonkey<br><br>

#### 2. Pick the right userscript<br>

* Let's you explore the profiles of moodle more easily by adding buttons to skip through them<br><br>

[Install ```More sidebar links```](https://github.com/melusc/lusc/raw/master/More%20sidebar%20links.user.js)
